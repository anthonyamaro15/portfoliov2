      "I built this project to speed up my workflow when navigating large directories. Traditional file explorers felt slow and clunky, so I decided to create a lightweight TUI (Terminal User Interface) tool in Rust. I actually use it on a daily basis to quickly search, preview, and open files directly from the terminal. This project helped me deepen my Rust skills and explore performance-focused development.",
